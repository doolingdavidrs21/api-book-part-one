    "In Chapter 4, you created your first API to fulfill the user stories identified in Chapter 1. The primary users you developed these for are data science users and advice website providers. The API will enable them to create analytics products such as dashboards, charts, and models using the SportsWorldCentral (SWC) fantasy data. Now you will create documentation to help them use your API. Documentation and features such as software development kits (SDKs) improve the developer experience (DX) for your technical users."

    "By creating SDKs in popular programming languages, an API provider can make the process of using the API much easier for consumers. These can help enforce responsible usage of the API, reducing some common problems such as overuse. If an API’s primary users are data scientists, this will greatly smooth the process of using your API. You will create an SDK for your API in Chapter 7."

    "Although these documentation pages are quite impressive, they are nothing without the OAS file. This is literally true, since FastAPI and Pydantic generate the OAS file at the /openapi.json path, and Redoc and Swagger UI generate their documentation from this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the OAS file is more than simply a way to generate documentation: it is a powerful API definition standard that allows many other tools to interact with your API. One quick example is that in Part III you will create a custom action that enables ChatGPT to answer questions using the data from your API. What information does it need for this? Your OAS file. This is just a drop in the bucket of what the OAS file is used for. The OpenApi.Tools website lists code generators, data validators, SDK generators, mock servers, and a dozen other categories of tools that use the OAS file."

For example, the full URL might be https://happy-pine-tree-1234-8000.app.github.dev/openapi.json in the browser.

One of the potential use cases for this specification is to assist generative AI applications that are based on large language models (LLMs). For more information about these applications, read Part III of this book."
