    "In Chapter 4, you created your first API to fulfill the user stories identified in Chapter 1. The primary users you developed these for are data science users and advice website providers. The API will enable them to create analytics products such as dashboards, charts, and models using the SportsWorldCentral (SWC) fantasy data. Now you will create documentation to help them use your API. Documentation and features such as software development kits (SDKs) improve the developer experience (DX) for your technical users."

    "By creating SDKs in popular programming languages, an API provider can make the process of using the API much easier for consumers. These can help enforce responsible usage of the API, reducing some common problems such as overuse. If an API’s primary users are data scientists, this will greatly smooth the process of using your API. You will create an SDK for your API in Chapter 7."
