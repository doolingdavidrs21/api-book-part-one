    "To create an API data scientists will love, you should give them a software development kit (SDK) to call the API with. This is an extra step that most API producers do not take, but it makes life much easier for your users. In this chapter, you will learn the value of SDKs and benefit from practical tips from several experts, and then you will create a Python SDK for the SWC Fantasy Football API. Building an SDK is the capstone of your Part I portfolio project."
