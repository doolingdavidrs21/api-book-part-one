## Public API
*Coming Soon*

We'll be deploying our application soon. Check back for the public API address.

## Getting Started

Since all of the data is public, the SWC API doesn't require any authentication.
All of the following data is available using GET endpoints that return
JSON data.


### Analytics

Get information about the health of the API and counts of leagues, teams, 
and players.

### Player

You can get a list of all NFL players, or search for an individual player
by player_id.

### Scoring

You can get a list of NFL player performances, including the fantasy points they
scored using SWC league scoring.


### Membership
Get information about all the SWC fantasy football leagues and the teams in them.

## Terms of Service

By using the API, you agree to the following terms of service:

- **Usage Limits**: You are allowed up to 2000 requests per day. Exceeding this 
                    limit may result in your API key being suspended.
- **No Warranty**: We don't provide any warranty of the API or its operation.

## Example Code

The API is built using FastAPI and provides various endpoints for accessing fantasy football data. Here's a sample endpoint that demonstrates the API's capabilities:

```python
@app.get(
    "/v0/players/",
    response_model=list[schemas.Player],
    summary="Get all the SWC players that meet all the parameters you sent with your request",
    tags=["players"],
)
def read_players(
    skip: int = Query(0),
    limit: int = Query(100),
    first_name: str = Query(None),
    last_name: str = Query(None),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
):
    players = crud.get_players(
        db,
        skip=skip,
        limit=limit,
        first_name=first_name,
        last_name=last_name,
    )
    return players
```

This endpoint demonstrates several key features:
- Query parameter validation using FastAPI's `Query`
- Database integration using SQLAlchemy sessions
- Pagination support through `skip` and `limit` parameters
- Optional filtering by player names
- Automatic response serialization using Pydantic models
- OpenAPI documentation generation with descriptive tags

To use this endpoint, you can make a GET request like:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/v0/players/?limit=5&first_name=Tom"
```
